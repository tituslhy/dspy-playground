       "1 Introduction\n",
       "\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" — Leonardo da Vinci\n",
       "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from merely generating text to autonomous agents capable of\n",
       "independently planning and executing complex tasks on behalf of users with limited human oversight [ 2]. These\n",
       "capabilities have enabled a wide range of applications, ranging from travel planning [ 3], computer use [ 4, 5, 6],\n",
       "to the multi-step research tasks [ 7]. To support such diverse and demanding tasks, a new class of systems called\n",
       "generalist agents has emerged. These agents are designed to handle a wide range of domains and tasks through a unified\n",
       "architecture, allowing them to generalize beyond task-specific solutions, such as OpenAI Deep Research [1] and Manus.\n",
       "However, most of the current general-purpose agents heavily rely on large-scale manual engineering, including tediously\n",
       "designed workflows, considerable pre-defined tools, and hardcoded components [8, 9]. This reliance introduces several\n",
       "critical limitations: i) It is impractical, if not impossible, to predefine all the tools required for the wide variety of\n",
       "real-world tasks an agent might encounter (imcomplete coverage); ii) Many complex tasks require agents to creatively\n",
       "compose new tools or leverage existing ones in novel ways while pre-designed workflow and hardcoded components\n",
       "constrain this compositional flexibility and inhibit the development of adaptive behaviors ( limited creativity and\n",
       "flexibility); iii) It is not always the case that the interface or environment of different tools are compatible with the agent\n",
       "(mismatch). For example, many useful tools are not written in Python, which makes it difficult, though not entirely\n",
       "impossible, for them to be pre-connected to the mainstream agent frameworks that are primarily written in Python.\n",
       "Together, these challenges ultimately hinder the scalability, adaptability, and generalization of existing generalist agents.\n",
       "In contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy built on two\n",
       "principles: i) Minimal Predefinition: Equip the agent with only a minimal set of core capabilities, avoiding manually\n",
       "engineered components for specific tasks or modalities; ii)Maximal Self-Evolution: Empower the agent to autonomously\n",
       "create, refine, and reuse external capabilities as needed. We instantiate this vision through Alita, a generalist agent built\n",
       "with a single core capability (i.e., the web agent) and a small set of general-purpose modules that enable self-directed\n",
       "capability expansion. Specifically, we take advantage of the Model Context Protocols (MCPs) 1 which is an open\n",
       "protocol that standardizes how different systems provide context to LLMs, and empower Alita to dynamically generate,\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" — Leonardo da Vinci\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from merely generating text to autonomous agents capable of\n",
      "independently planning and executing complex tasks on behalf of users with limited human oversight [ 2]. These\n",
      "capabilities have enabled a wide range of applications, ranging from travel planning [ 3], computer use [ 4, 5, 6],\n",
      "to the multi-step research tasks [ 7]. To support such diverse and demanding tasks, a new class of systems called\n",
      "generalist agents has emerged. These agents are designed to handle a wide range of domains and tasks through a unified\n",
      "architecture, allowing them to generalize beyond task-specific solutions, such as OpenAI Deep Research [1] and Manus.\n",
      "However, most of the current general-purpose agents heavily rely on large-scale manual engineering, including tediously\n",
      "designed workflows, considerable pre-defined tools, and hardcoded components [8, 9]. This reliance introduces several\n",
      "critical limitations: i) It is impractical, if not impossible, to predefine all the tools required for the wide variety of\n",
      "real-world tasks an agent might encounter (imcomplete coverage); ii) Many complex tasks require agents to creatively\n",
      "compose new tools or leverage existing ones in novel ways while pre-designed workflow and hardcoded components\n",
      "constrain this compositional flexibility and inhibit the development of adaptive behaviors ( limited creativity and\n",
      "flexibility); iii) It is not always the case that the interface or environment of different tools are compatible with the agent\n",
      "(mismatch). For example, many useful tools are not written in Python, which makes it difficult, though not entirely\n",
      "impossible, for them to be pre-connected to the mainstream agent frameworks that are primarily written in Python.\n",
      "Together, these challenges ultimately hinder the scalability, adaptability, and generalization of existing generalist agents.\n",
      "In contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy built on two\n",
      "principles: i) Minimal Predefinition: Equip the agent with only a minimal set of core capabilities, avoiding manually\n",
      "engineered components for specific tasks or modalities; ii)Maximal Self-Evolution: Empower the agent to autonomously\n",
      "create, refine, and reuse external capabilities as needed. We instantiate this vision through Alita, a generalist agent built\n",
      "with a single core capability (i.e., the web agent) and a small set of general-purpose modules that enable self-directed\n",
      "capability expansion. Specifically, we take advantage of the Model Context Protocols (MCPs) 1 which is an open\n",
      "protocol that standardizes how different systems provide context to LLMs, and empower Alita to dynamically generate,\n",
      "adapt, and reuse MCPs based on the demands of each task rather than relying on static, predefined tools. This shift from\n",

      "The concept of a Generalist Agent aims to construct an AI agent system capable of collaboratively completing a variety\n",
      "of complex tasks in a real-world environment. OWL [ 8] introduces a method that decomposes complex tasks into\n",
      "subtasks and dynamically allocates them to worker nodes with specialized toolkits. Omne [ 11] proposes a multi-\n",
      "agent collaborative development framework, where each agent possesses an independent system structure, enabling\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" — Leonardo da Vinci\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from merely generating text to autonomous agents capable of\n",
      "independently planning and executing complex tasks on behalf of users with limited human oversight [ 2]. These\n",
      "capabilities have enabled a wide range of applications, ranging from travel planning [ 3], computer use [ 4, 5, 6],\n",
      "to the multi-step research tasks [ 7]. To support such diverse and demanding tasks, a new class of systems called\n",
      "generalist agents has emerged. These agents are designed to handle a wide range of domains and tasks through a unified\n",
      "architecture, allowing them to generalize beyond task-specific solutions, such as OpenAI Deep Research [1] and Manus.\n",
      "However, most of the current general-purpose agents heavily rely on large-scale manual engineering, including tediously\n",
      "designed workflows, considerable pre-defined tools, and hardcoded components [8, 9]. This reliance introduces several\n",
      "critical limitations: i) It is impractical, if not impossible, to predefine all the tools required for the wide variety of\n",
      "real-world tasks an agent might encounter (imcomplete coverage); ii) Many complex tasks require agents to creatively\n",
      "compose new tools or leverage existing ones in novel ways while pre-designed workflow and hardcoded components\n",
      "constrain this compositional flexibility and inhibit the development of adaptive behaviors ( limited creativity and\n",
      "flexibility); iii) It is not always the case that the interface or environment of different tools are compatible with the agent\n",
      "(mismatch). For example, many useful tools are not written in Python, which makes it difficult, though not entirely\n",
      "impossible, for them to be pre-connected to the mainstream agent frameworks that are primarily written in Python.\n",
      "Together, these challenges ultimately hinder the scalability, adaptability, and generalization of existing generalist agents.\n",
      "In contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy built on two\n",
      "principles: i) Minimal Predefinition: Equip the agent with only a minimal set of core capabilities, avoiding manually\n",
      "engineered components for specific tasks or modalities; ii)Maximal Self-Evolution: Empower the agent to autonomously\n",
      "create, refine, and reuse external capabilities as needed. We instantiate this vision through Alita, a generalist agent built\n",
      "with a single core capability (i.e., the web agent) and a small set of general-purpose modules that enable self-directed\n",
      "capability expansion. Specifically, we take advantage of the Model Context Protocols (MCPs) 1 which is an open\n",
      "protocol that standardizes how different systems provide context to LLMs, and empower Alita to dynamically generate,\n",
      "adapt, and reuse MCPs based on the demands of each task rather than relying on static, predefined tools. This shift from\n",

      "1. **MCP Brainstorming** – The LLM first introspects the task, identifies missing capabilities, and proposes new *Model‑agnostic Toolchains* (MCPs) that can be built on‑the‑fly.  \n",
      "2. **Web Agent Retrieval** – It searches public code repositories and APIs to find existing libraries that can implement the proposed MCP, thereby avoiding the need for the model to write code from scratch.  \n",
      "3. **Dynamic Environment Construction** – The LLM generates the necessary environment‑setup commands (e.g., conda or pip installs) and integrates them with the retrieved code.  \n",
      "4. **Self‑Generated MCP Packaging** – The model packages the retrieved code and environment instructions into a reusable MCP, which can be invoked as a tool for the current task.  \n",
      "5. **Iterative Refinement** – If the first attempt fails, the model can regenerate the MCP or adjust its reasoning chain, effectively learning from its own failures.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By allowing the model to **create, evolve, and reuse tools in real time**, ALITA turns the LLM into an autonomous reasoner that no longer relies on a fixed set of pre‑built tools or workflows. This self‑evolving capability scales with the underlying model’s coding and reasoning power, enabling more complex, multi‑step problem solving without human‑written tool libraries.  \n",

      "Yes – the agent is designed to operate autonomously. It achieves this through the Alita framework, a lightweight manager‑worker architecture that plans and executes tasks on its own. Alita does not rely on a fixed set of pre‑defined tools or workflows; instead, it learns and refines its own methods (MCPs) during operation, allowing it to handle a wide range of complex tasks with minimal human oversight. The agent does not employ the Model Context Protocol; its autonomy comes solely from Alita’s self‑evolving capabilities, which include the ability to generate and use its own tools as needed.\n",
