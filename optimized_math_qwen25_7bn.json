        "question": "What is the nearest integer to $(5+2\\sqrt7)^4$?",
        "reasoning": "When we expand this out, we get a bunch of terms with $\\sqrt7$ in them. To avoid painful estimation, we do the following trick: Add $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ to this expression. We know that $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ is small, since $2\\sqrt7=\\sqrt{28}$ is close to $5=\\sqrt{25}$, at least compared to $6=\\sqrt{36}$. When we add these together, the $\\sqrt7$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, $$(5+2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4+4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2+4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4$$ whereas $$(5-2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4-4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2-4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4.$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(5^4+6\\cdot5^2(2\\sqrt7)^2+(2\\sqrt7)^4)=2(625+4200+784)=11218.$$ Since the term we added, $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\\boxed{11218}$ is the closest integer to $(5+2\\sqrt7)^4$.",

        "question": "Rectangle $ABCD$ has center $O$ and $AB\/AD=k$. A point is randomly chosen from the interior of rectangle $ABCD$. What is the probability that it is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices?

        "reasoning": "The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$.

Therefore, exactly half the area is shaded, and the overall probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$, independent of $k$.",
